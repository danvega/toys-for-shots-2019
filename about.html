          <p>Toys for Shots is an annual fundraiser/holiday party. The primary goal&nbsp;of this very special event is
            to collect as many new, unwrapped toys as possible&nbsp;for The Marine&nbsp;Toys for Tots Foundation.
            &nbsp;Your gift&nbsp;will&nbsp;spread so much joy&nbsp;to a deserving Cleveland area child this Christmas.
            The Marines will be present and prepared with a large truck&nbsp;to distribute&nbsp;all of the toys we
            expect to donate.</p>
          <p>Why the name&nbsp;"Toys for Shots?"&nbsp; The idea was to&nbsp;encourage people&nbsp;to go out and buy a
            toy for a family in need in exchange for&nbsp;a free drink&nbsp;(1 toy for 1 shot..."Toys for Shots"). The
            idea worked, and we are happy to offer it again this year. Please bring at least one new, unwrapped toy and
            we will give you 2 free drink tickets.</p>
          <p>Although our purpose is to provide a bit of holiday cheer&nbsp;to children in need, this event is also a
            holiday party! Expect to dance and have a good time with friends,&nbsp;enjoy some&nbsp;great&nbsp;food and
            participate in an exciting&nbsp;raffle. We have an awesome lineup of items to be raffled off this year, so
            be sure to bring a few extra bucks to purchase the Chinese raffle tickets!</p>
          <p>This will mark the 12th year for this event and we have some very high expectations. Toys for
            Shots&nbsp;has grown each year in donations, gifts and attendance. We look
            forward&nbsp;to&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;the best Toys for Shots event yet, and have already grown into one
            of&nbsp;Northeast Ohio's biggest toy drives. We hope you will join us for an amazing night on December 14,
            2019.</p>

          <p><strong>About The party</strong></p>
          <p>Shooters on the Water is located on the west bank of the Flats in downtown Cleveland. This will be a
            private event. Please <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a> so that we can get an accurate headcount and guest list.
            There will only be 800 tickets available this year, and once they are gone, they are gone. If you bring a
            toy, you will receive two drink tickets in return. This will hopefully encourage everyone to bring a
            donation to this wonderful cause. If you do not bring a toy, there will be a $20.00 donation fee at the
            door.</p>
          <p><strong>The Raffle</strong></p>
          <p>The difference between a traditional raffle and a Chinese auction is that in a raffle with multiple prizes,
            there is one "hat" from which names are drawn. &nbsp;In a Chinese auction, each prize has its own
            "hat."&nbsp;This allows ticket buyers to choose which prize to focus on, as opposed to having a first,
            second, third, etc. prize.</p>
          <p>We are looking for <a href="donate.html">raffle prize donations</a> to help make this event a smash. We
            have some ideas for raffle baskets, but if you have ideas please let us know. You can find out what raffle
            prizes have already been donated by <a href="raffle.html">visiting the raffle page</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Entertainment</strong></p>
          <p>We will have a DJ playing your favorite tunes all night long!</p>
          <p><strong>Photographers</strong></p>
          <p>We will have a photographer on hand to capture the event.
            Please make sure you dress to
            impress and come ready to flash that smile!</p>
